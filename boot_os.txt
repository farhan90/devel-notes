Booting an OS in a laptop or hardware
=====================================

- BIOS is started, which is at a known address in the
memory

- BIOS is at address 0xFFFF0

- BIOS is then responsible for figuring out how the boot device
to use. It also does some basic checks to for power and memory

- The boot device contains Master Boot Record (MBR) in the first
block or block 0. Since block sizes are 512 bytes, the entire
boot loader is fitted there

    <-----------------      512 bytes -------------------------> 
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    |     Bootloader                       |    Partition  | M |
    |                                      |    Table      |   |   
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    <----------- 446 bytes-----------------><---- 64 bytes--><-2 bytes->


    Bootloader - 446 bytes
    Partition table - 64 bytes (4 partitions each of 16 bytes)
    Magic Number - 2 bytes


- The primary boot loader looks through the partition table to find 
an active partition. It also scans the other partition to ensure they
are inactive

- Once the active partition is found, then its boot record/Volume Boot Record(VBR) is read from
the device into memory


- With GRUB there is a bootloader 1 and bootloader 1.5 stage. The bootloader 1
loads the bootloader 1.5.

- Bootloader 1.5 can then read the file system on the disk to read the GRUB conf file
which contains the location of the kernel and initrd image. This loads the kernel selection
prompt


- Once a kernel is selected the second stage boot loader which then works on uncompressing the kernel....etc


UEFI
====

- In modern computers BIOS is no longer used, but instead the UEFI framework

- It's more powerful than BIOS 

- Can boot from larger devices

- It reads disks with GUID Partition Table (GPT)
